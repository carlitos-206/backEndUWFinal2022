The Washington state Deparment of Natural Resources responds to an average of 
`1,541 wildfires` per year, and this number is expected to rise: More trees 
fall, decay, and become ample fuel for wildland fires due to extreme weather 
patterns reducing annual snowpack, driving up disease, invasive parasites, and
hotter, drier summers.[^1] As climate change challenges our local forests to 
recover from annual fire seasons, these fuel sources pile up and ignite, 
resulting in catastrophic events like the 2020 West Coast fire season.[^2]

During the 2020 Labor Day windstorm fires across Washington scorched over 
`500,000 acres` in the span of less than `36 hours`, burning down the 
communities of Malden and Pine City and destroying `181 homes`.[^3] These winds 
traveled the West Coast, fanning historic fires in Oregon and California that 
burnt a total of `10,000,000 acres` and cost nearly `$20 billion in damages` by 
the time the year was over.[^4] [^5] The smoke resulting from these fires 
produced readings over `200 AQI` in local major cities;[^6] a level of particle
pollution deemed ‚ÄúVery Unhealthy‚Äù and described as increasing ‚Äúthe risk of 
health effects for everyone‚Äù by the Environmental Protection Agency.[^7]

**The problem:** How can we provide information about wildfires throughout 
Washington state‚Äôs history in a way that‚Äôs...:

1. Accessible to the public,
2. Helpful to the public in analyzing fires of the past?

## Solution: Washington Wildfires Community

<!--
Design a solution (Database & Front End people lead this process)
  * Include this in the repo's README.md
  * General overview of what you plan to build
  * Description of the databases that will be built and the collections they'll 
  contain, planned schema for documents in the collections, and source for this 
  data (manually creating from information found on the Washington Department of 
  Fish & Wildlife website? importing a publicly available dataset of Tweets? 
  converting then importing from a publicly available API of Library of Congress
  catalog?)
  * List of endpoints the API will have
  * List of any external tools that will be necessary (not libraries, like 
  React, but separate systems or third party tools, like a second database
  * Describe the functionality that the front end app will have
-->


**Washington Wildfires Community** is an interactive map of Washington State's 
historic wildfires with data sourced from Wildland Fire Interagency Geospatial 
Services (WFIGS). We've filtered the data to make it leaner and more specific to
Washington state. Registered users will be able to make comments on the data 
provided.

* üî• Features data on fires from the last 5 years, including dates, ignition 
causes, cost of damages, location, and more
* üîé Examine fires by month & year
* üó®Ô∏è Sign up, log in, and start a discussion on recent fires
* üîñ Revisit fires of your interest using bookmarks

### For Developers

#### Setting Up & Running

You'll need to serve the **backend** and **frontend** to run the app locally and
develop its functionality.

1. **Serve the backend:**
  * Enter `/backend`: `cd backend`
  * `npm install` to install all backend packages
  * `npm start` to serve the backend at `https://localhost:5000`
2. **Serve the frontend:**
  * Enter `/frontend/fire-app`: `cd frontend/fire-app`
  * `npm install` to install all frontend packages
  * `npm start` to serve the frontend at `https://localhost:3000`

You should now be able to access the app's frontend at `http://localhost:3000`
and use the app's full functionality.

**‚ÄΩ** *Frontend isn't getting data* - Confirm backend is being served @ 
`https://localhost:5000`. If it's not, run `npm start` in `/backend`.

**‚ÄΩ** *Backend/frontend won't serve* - Confirm your `5000` & `3000` ports
aren't being used by other applications. If they are, quit the other
applications or change the ports the backend and frontend use. The backend port
can be changed in `/backend/server.js`.

#### Testing

**Testing the API routes:**
  * Enter `/backend`: `cd backend`
  * `npm test` from `/backend` to run the Jest test suite
  * Test files are located in `/backend/routes`

**‚ÄΩ** *Tests aren't running* - Make sure `/backend` package dependencies are
installed. Run `npm install` in `/backend`, then try `npm test` again.

## Project Timeline
